== Description ==

This plugin was made out of necessity for anyone who actually works with PPN will know their service is very cumbersome to say the least.  I wanted a quick and easy shortcode implementation of various search forms for Flights, Hotels, Car Rentals, and Vacation Packages.

This also has the ability to output a list of customizable text links based on a CSV file which interacts with the various search boxes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes and no... you can change the styles by targeting the form utilizing the `.ppn-search-box-wrap` class.  But you can't add any new form fields.
